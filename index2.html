			<h2>GAME CONTROLS</h2>
			<img src="images/controls.jpeg">
				<p id="p">League only requires a small number of keys to play with. Namely, three groupings! First off, your mouse with left and right click. Left click is used to select items or targets or drag your inventory around. However, right click is used to attack and move. Then there’s the primary ability keys: Q, W, E, and R. You’ll press those to cast your spells or abilities in game. Also, you have two special summoner spells on D and F. Lastly, the numbers 1-7 correspond to the inventory your champion has in game. If you’ve got something that can be consumed, like a potion, or an item with a special active, press that button to chug that potion or use that active!</p>
			<h3 id="h3">ITEMS</h3>
				<p id="p">Numbers 1-7 correspond to the items in your inventory. If an item can be used or consumed, press that button.</p>
			<h3 id="h3">SUMMONER SPELLS</h3>
				<p id="p">D and F are special summoner spells. They're like a primary ability only with a far longer time between each use.</p>
			<h3 id="h3">LEFT-CLICK</h3>
				<p id="p">Allows you to select items, targets, drag inventory items around, or confirm actions like casting an ability.</p>
			<h3 id="h3">RIGHT-CLICK</h3>
				<p id="p">What your use to move to a location or to attack at target.</p>
			<h3 id="h3">ABILITIES</h3>

				<p id="p">The B key is the Recall button! Press B when you want to return to base.</p>
			<h2>PINGS</h2>
			<img src="images/ping.jpeg">
			<p id="p">Pressing G on your keyboard anywhere on the map or in game will ping that part of the ground. Doing so on a character will mark them. When you press and hold down G, a small ping wheel appears! By dragging your mouse in any of the four directions (Up, Right, Down or Left), you can ping the appropriate message once you let go of the G button. Here’s what you can ping, and each ping describes what it means on the button!</p>
			<h3 id="h3">- UP:"DANGER"</h3>
			<h3 id="h3">- DOWN:"ASSIST ME"</h3>	
			<h3 id="h3">- LEFT:"ENEMY MISSING"</h3>
			<h3 id="h3">- RIGHT:"ON MY WAY"</h3>
			<h2>SCOREBOARD</h2>
			<img src="images/scoreboard.jpeg">
			<p id="p">The Tab Scoreboard. Pressing Tab allows you to see a broad overview of everyone’s champions, items and score. Use it to briefly see how the game is progressing for your team with a glance.</p>
			<h3 id="h3">TEAM SCORE</h3>
				<p id="p">The Team Score. This area shows how the game is going on a team basis, as well as how many dragons each team has secured.</p>
			<h3 id="h3">OBJECTIVE TIMERS</h3>
				<p id="p">Objective Timers. If you’re unsure when a Red Buff or Dragon or Baron spawns, press Tab and look at the top of your screen to know when they’re spawning. Put your mouse cursor over any of them and the name of the buff will be displayed if you forget!</p>

			<h2>STRUCTURES</h2>

			<img src="images/turret.png">
				<p id="p">Turrets help protect you and your base. Be cautious though since the enemy has them as well. When approaching or attacking a turret make sure to keep the following in mind.
				<ul>They attack the nearest enemy target (Minion or Champion)
				If there are a group of minions in the Turret’s range, it will continue killing them before targeting a Champion
				Attacking a Champion under an enemy Turret will draw fire from the Turret.
				Avoid consecutive hits from the Turret, since it deals additional damage.
				Keep your ears open. Turrets will warn you with a loud audible sound whenever they target you. Back away when you hear it.
				Once destroyed a Turret will provide some gold to you and your teammates and move your team one step closer to destroying the enemy Nexus.</ul></p>

Every few waves a siege minion also spawns. Minions automatically march along a set path toward the enemy base and will immediately engage any champions or enemy minions they encounter. Minions prioritize attacking enemy minions. However, attacking an enemy champion will cause them to turn and fight you instead so be careful. Don't ignore minions! They are an excellent source of gold and experience points to make you stronger.</p>

			<h2>ITEM SHOP</h2>
			<p id="p">Every champion wants something to give them that slight edge in a fight. Lucky for them there is an item shop back at their team’s base chock full of weapons, armor and other baubles to help them through even the toughest of fights.</p>
			<h3>ITEMS AS STATS</h3>
			<p id="p">You may be a little confused about why a champion with a ranged weapon needs a sword, or why a melee champion would purchase a bow. Don’t worry about the looks! Items in game simply increase a champion’s stats to make them stronger--their actual weapon doesn’t change.</p>
			<h3>GOLD</h3>
			<p id="p">Buying items will require gold. There are multiple ways to earn it in game, like killing minions, monsters, enemy champions, and structures. In addition, your champion will passively generate a small amount of gold every second to make sure you’re always working your way toward your next purchase.</p>
			<h3>UPGRADING ITEMS</h3>
			<p id="p">Most basic items can be combined to form new and more powerful equipment. Upgrading to a higher tier item is as simple as following its build path in the item shop.</p>
